'''So when constructing a Layer im obligated to make some choices, 
such as, how to initialize the weights/bias, how to use the properties for each 
different type of neural network, and others, so I'll let math guide me along with
some code preferences aswell. All of them will be registred in the mathematical
guide of this repo, this text is a reminder for myself not forget to register that =)'''
